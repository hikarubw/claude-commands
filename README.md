# My Claude Commands

> Personal collection of custom commands for Claude Code

## Overview

This is my personal collection of Claude Code commands that I use for daily development. Feel free to use or fork them if you find them helpful.

These commands are designed to work with any programming language - Claude automatically detects your project and adapts accordingly.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Token Usage Note
The `plan` and `research` commands use deep critical thinking mode ("ultrathink") which consumes 5-10x more tokens than regular commands. Use them when you need thorough analysis and are willing to invest in comprehensive results.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Reinstallation Warning

**Reinstalling will overwrite ALL your local changes!**
- Any commands you've modified will be replaced
- Any commands you've deleted will return
- Any custom commands you've added will be lost

**Before reinstalling:**
1. The installer will ask if you want to backup existing commands
2. **Always choose "y" to backup** if you've made any local changes
3. Backups are saved to `~/.claude/commands.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`

### 1. Install Commands

#### One-Line Install (Recommended)

**Install globally (recommended for personal use):**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hikarubw/claude-commands/main/install-curl.sh | bash -s -- --user
```

**Or clone and install:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hikarubw/claude-commands.git
cd claude-commands
./install.sh --user
```

### 2. Use Commands
```bash
/user:help          # Show all available commands
```

### 3. Start Using
```bash
# Initialize a new project
/user:init

# Check code quality
/user:check

# Push with smart workflow
/user:push

# Before ending your session
/user:handover
```

## üì¶ My Essential Commands

Only 6 commands that add real value beyond what Claude already does well:

- **`/user:init`** - Initialize a new project with comprehensive setup (CI/CD, testing, docs)
- **`/user:check`** - Run ALL quality checks in parallel with actionable insights  
- **`/user:plan`** - Create detailed project plans using critical thinking mode ("ultrathink") ‚ö†Ô∏è *High token usage*
- **`/user:push`** - Smart git workflow with intelligent commits and CI monitoring
- **`/user:handover`** - Prepare session handover documentation
- **`/user:research`** - Deep technical research using critical thinking mode ("ultrathink") ‚ö†Ô∏è *High token usage*

### Why So Few Commands?

I removed commands for things Claude already does well:
- Building projects? Just ask: "build my project"
- Running tests? Just ask: "run tests"
- Debugging? Just ask: "debug this error"
- Code review? Just ask: "review my code"

These 6 commands provide complex workflows that go beyond simple tasks.

## üåü Why I Made These

- **Language agnostic** - Works with any programming language
- **Saves time** - Common tasks automated
- **Consistent workflow** - Same commands across all projects
- **Smart defaults** - Claude figures out the details

## üõ†Ô∏è Managing Your Custom Commands

### Preserving Local Changes

Since reinstalling overwrites everything, here are strategies to keep your customizations:

1. **Create a Custom Folder**
   ```bash
   # Add your own commands here - they won't be in the repo
   mkdir ~/.claude/commands/custom
   # Create custom commands like: ~/.claude/commands/custom/mycommand.md
   # Use them with: /user:custom:mycommand
   ```

2. **Fork This Repository**
   - Fork to your own GitHub account
   - Commit your changes to your fork
   - Install from your fork instead

3. **Manual Backup**
   ```bash
   # Before updating
   cp -r ~/.claude/commands ~/.claude/commands.my-backup
   # After updating, restore your custom commands
   cp ~/.claude/commands.my-backup/custom/* ~/.claude/commands/custom/
   ```

## üìñ Want to Fork?

Feel free to fork this repo and customize the commands for your own workflow. The commands are just markdown files with instructions for Claude.

To use with your own GitHub:
```bash
./setup-repo.sh YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
```

See [docs](docs/) for more details about how the commands work.
