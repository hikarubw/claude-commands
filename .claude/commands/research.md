# Deep Research Command

Comprehensive research on technical topics with multi-source analysis.

## Task
Use "ultrathink" mode to conduct thorough research. Apply extended critical thinking to:
- Challenge assumptions
- Consider edge cases and counterarguments
- Synthesize complex information
- Identify non-obvious patterns
- Question conventional wisdom
- Explore second and third-order effects

## Research Process

1. **Multi-Agent Research**
   Deploy parallel research agents to gather information from:
   - Academic sources - Papers, studies, specifications
   - Industry sources - Best practices, case studies
   - Community sources - Forums, blogs, discussions
   - Technical sources - Implementation details, benchmarks
   - Comparison sources - Alternative solutions

2. **Information Synthesis**
   - Cross-reference findings
   - Validate with multiple sources
   - Identify patterns and contradictions
   - Extract consensus views
   - Highlight dissenting opinions

3. **Analysis Framework**
   Apply critical thinking to evaluate:
   - Claims vs evidence
   - Marketing hype vs reality
   - Hidden costs and trade-offs
   - Long-term implications
   - Edge cases and failure modes

## Output Format
Create structured research document with:
- Executive summary
- Detailed analysis by aspect
- Comparison matrices
- Visual diagrams where helpful
- Implementation guidance
- Decision framework
- Sources and references

## Archive
Save all research to:
- .claude/research/topic-name-date.md (main findings)
- .claude/research/sources.md (references)
- .claude/research/raw-notes.md (detailed notes)
- Update CLAUDE.md with key findings
