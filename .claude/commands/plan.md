# Project Planning & Architecture Command

Create comprehensive project plans with architecture decisions, tech stack recommendations, and implementation roadmaps.

## Task
Use "ultrathink" mode to create a detailed project plan. Engage deep critical thinking to:
- Anticipate hidden complexities and technical debt
- Consider long-term maintainability and scalability
- Evaluate trade-offs beyond surface level
- Identify potential failure modes early
- Challenge common architectural patterns when inappropriate
- Think through second-order consequences of decisions

## Process

1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Understand project goals and constraints
   - Identify target users and use cases
   - Define success criteria
   - Assess technical requirements

2. **Deep Research & Critical Analysis**
   Launch parallel research agents to investigate:
   - Market Research - Similar solutions and best practices
   - Technical Research - Technology options and trade-offs
   - Architecture Patterns - Suitable design patterns
   - Implementation Strategies - Development approaches

3. **Architecture Design**
   - System architecture diagrams
   - Component breakdown
   - Data flow design
   - API specifications
   - Security considerations

4. **Technology Stack**
   Recommend optimal stack based on requirements, team expertise, scalability needs, budget, and time constraints.

5. **Implementation Roadmap**
   Create phased plan with realistic timelines.

6. **Documentation**
   Generate Architecture Decision Records, technical specifications, risk assessment, and resource planning. Update CLAUDE.md with key decisions.

## Output Format
Deliver comprehensive markdown document with:
- Executive Summary
- Technology Stack with justifications
- Architecture diagrams and descriptions
- Phased implementation plan
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Resource requirements
- Success metrics
